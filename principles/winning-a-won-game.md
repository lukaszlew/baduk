# Winning a won game

When opponent have one or more weak groups, it is often beneficial to, instead of attack the weak groups, do secure cuts in your own.
This removes multiple different sente moves (various moves close to the cut), severly limiting defender's options.
Note that we often want to avoid giving sente moves to weak group anyway
(avoid playing contact moves, or on opponent attach play extension instead of hane more often than usual)
