There are several things that can be done to make the lessons engaging and effective.

## Example contrasting

When illustrating Go principles, one needs to give both positive and negative examples of a given principle.
With only positive examples, while the illusion of teaching is achieved, the effectiveness might be low.
With both positive and negative examples, the reader might feel more confused, but the effectiveness of the lesson might be higher.
[This applies not only to Go, but whenever the learning is done without a teacher interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8).

## Exercises

Exercises are essential for learning. 
We aim to make the autmated tool support that, but we don't know how yet.

## Skill decomposition

Deliberate practice teaches us that it is most effective to practice skills separate (e.g. practicing musical scales in isolation).
There is a good decomposition of Go strength into Go skills.

## Reading ease

It is important that the reading is engaging. 
This can be achieved through various means:
 - personal stories about the author or
 - some context on where the example position came from or
 - motivational story about the value of the current lesson or
 - strong and colorful language.

The last technique is probably the most useful. 
"Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama is probably the finest example of these teaching techniques.
